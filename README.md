**redialog** describe any process that involves revisiting, updating, or iterating on the dialogue or conversation between a user and a system that translates text into functional software.
While when codialog uses human interface, redialog uses Machine To Machine M2M interface

1. **Reengagement in Dialogue**:
   If "dialogware" involves creating software through a dialogue (or interactive text prompts), "redialog" could imply reinitiating or continuing that dialogue process, perhaps to refine or expand the generated software.

2. **Dialogue Revision**:
   It could refer to revising or editing the text-based instructions or dialogue used by the dialogware to generate software, therefore offering a means to update or modify the resulting software components after initial creation.

3. **Dialogue-Based Feedback**:
   "Redialog" might suggest a feedback loop where the software generated by the dialogware is evaluated, and the findings or user feedback are used to regenerate or update the software through another "dialogue" with the tool.

4. **Reverse Engineering through Dialogue**:
   Another interpretation could be using dialogue to reverse engineer or deconstruct existing software back into a high-level descriptive text format, which could then be modified and turned back into software, essentially "re-dialoguing" the software.
